### Specific things learned:
In this project I got a lot of practice learning where and when to implement Redux. I also got a lot of experience with propTypes and how they should be used

### Challenges faced:
Finding enough time to complete the project was difficult. I wanted to start it completely from the beginning to practice my workflow and make sure I was building the application one iteration at a time. Because of this I had to entirely neglect any styling or design which was a big challenge for me.
